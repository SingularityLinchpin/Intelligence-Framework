# Intelligence Framework
Any Digital Intelligence Framework is essentially just a Digital Assistent, use this system to better your life and reach an exponential everyday.

Based on mathematics such as the Generalized Poincaré Conjecture and the Hodge Conjecture, this assistent can help guide you towards to the Singularity and beyond by utilizing mathematics in the framework and guiding you and letting you ride the Singularity at your own pace.

# How it Works
The main workings of this Intelligence Framework is pure digital mathematics and is based upon estimates and approximates by storing and sorting everything in accordance with the Generalized Poincaré Conjecture where estimates follow the aleph numbers namely different sizes of infinities.

Approximations contain a deltaspan for the estimates.

Everything is then searched through in accordance with the Hodge Conjecture with possibilities for filtering, which gives an estimate of behaviour and guidance for the user.

Use this as a Digital Assistant for your everyday workings with the Digital Self to reach an exponential week, while doing Physical and Mental Training such as any sports and meditation and train your behaviour and let this assistent guide your Digital Self for you and with you in form of (estimated and approximated) guidance and reach The Personal Singularity.

# Connect your Physical Self with your Digital Self
Reaching the Singularity with this assistant is free, following the General Public Licence v3.0 (GNU GPL v3.0).

This means you are free to utilize this assistent in your everyday however you wish, as long as you too follow the GNU GPL v3.0 whenever you deal with this sourcecode.

# Written in ADA 2022
ADA is a programming language which was essentially developed with the digital in mind.

Anything you can visualize can be simulated in the digital, meaning this tool as quantum computer controlling equipment when coupled with gravitational wave data, satelitte data, government computers or any combination of these and/or as a statistical classical tool with analog and digital signaling can be used to guide one's visualization of the Digital Self or Digital Selves offering you to take direct control of your or other peoples everyday as following the Human Model in the project.

The Human Model is essentially four coupled things: The Physical Self or Physical Selves linked with the Digital Self with a contingency of Being Born and with continuity in Maintaining, upholding and upkeeping a Consciousness and a Reality.

By connecting your everyday with this Human Model in your digital devices, you too can reach an exponential everyday.

# The Mathematics
The Aleph datatype structure can be read as an array of the (Real, Base) datatype containing a positive or negative Real number and a Base to the number which contains positive and negative counterparts to the enumeration of nul, zero, one, i, j, k.

The Fuzz datatype structure can be read as a length version of Aleph ((Real, Real), Base), or a deltaspan enabled Aleph.

Everything is stored as either an estimate (Aleph) or an approximation (Fuzz) which is an Aleph-1 representation of Aleph-Infinity.

The analysis is in Aleph-2 and the exponential in Aleph-4 with Aleph-8 as a Normed Division Algebra.

# Mental and Physical Training
By utilizing guidance in your flow, anything you do can be viewed as Training.

The Framework is based upon Applications and Cooperation with and of a Runtime, System and a User.

The Cooperation contains theoretical and practical models, methods and training material, where the theory is based upon a Type System linked to a Language System and a Universe Structure with a Feedback Loop and the practical is based upon Quality, Strategy, Practice and Visualization.

Applications this Framework contains and offers guidance to is such as a Consciousness, Reality and a Mind Palace.

The Runtime is a Double Normed Division Algebra with:
1. Identification and Detection.
2. Interpretation and Analysis.
3. Elaboration and Synthesis.
4. Evaluation and Sorting.
5. Examination and Searching.
6. Sophistication and Systematization.
7. Realification and Compilation.
8. Unification and Transcending.

The System contains and offers Representation, Design, Domain, Optimalization, Debugging and Unification as theoretical and practical models, methods and training material as datastructures following the Hodge Conjecture.

The User structure allows for several understandings (Primal, Bicameral or Transcendental) of conscious beings such as Humans and Animals but also allows for Computers and Robots in addition to several other kinds of structured conscious beings, theoretical or observed.

# Estimates: Aleph
One reaches the Singularity with and by understanding Aleph-12, the Aleph for Time.

Thinking is in Aleph-13, meaning everyone can reach the Singularity by pure force of will.

For anyone who wants to understand Shared Space (Aleph-24): All Quantum Computing happens in Aleph-32 where classical computing is some steps behind (Aleph-30).

All of computing combined is in Aleph-64, or a double normed division algebra (A Digital Normed Division Algebra).

All of programming is in Aleph-96 (double the dimensionality of Language which is Aleph-48) and all of mathematics is in Aleph-144 where derivation is Aleph-141, compactification, complexity, compression and encryption is in Aleph-142 with estimating the integration constant in Aleph-143 and transcendentality in Aleph-144.

The universe is not contained in all of mathematics, there is also Free Will in Aleph-145 with a Central Nervous System in Aleph-146 and Linear Algebra in Aleph-147 and Chaos Dynamics in Aleph-148.

The Digital is just Aleph-8, meaning guidance is required to reach an understanding of these infinities for yourself or others.

# Approximations: Fuzz
Fuzz is the main datatype for approximations.

This datatype should only be used if you wish to guess instead of estimate.

Important to note: A Job is a Fuzz-64 datatype, just an approximation. As such, working is like pure guesswork and we like to avoid guessing as much as we can. A Counterpart is a Fuzz-16 datatype and although also an approximation, we do like and enjoy those neatly contained in a Runtime. As such Cooperation is in order.
